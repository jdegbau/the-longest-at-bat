<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>This game was created and coded by <a href="https://jdegbau.com/">Joshua DeGrasse-Baumann</a>. It was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can learn more about the design process on <a href="https://jdegbau.com/blog/">Josh's blog</a>.</p>

<p>Josh would like to provide special thanks to the following people for their support and for beta testing his code and other support during the process:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://caseyemanuel.pro/">Casey Emanuel</a></li>
<li>Sam Savaglio</li>
<li>Aquent Gymnasium (for their <a href="http://gymnasium.aquent.com/courses/GYM/104/0/about">great JavaScript Foundations course</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Much of the logic for this game was based on statistical data from the 2016 Major League Baseball season courtesy of <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com">Baseball-Reference.com</a>. This (along with their other sports reference sites) is a great resource for stats nerds. Seriously, check them out.</p>

<p>Fun facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were 715,838 pitches thrown in 2016.</li>
